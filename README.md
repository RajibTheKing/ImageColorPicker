#Project Name: ImageColorPicker

#Description: 
	If we need to process image data or real time video data, we need to extract RGB or YUV values.
This application is a simple solution to get RGB and YUV values from images. There exists a lot of
color picker tools, but this application is specially created to get values in YUV color space.

#User Manual:
	i) Run this application using jar file. (Jar file is also uploaded in this repository, make sure JDK is installed in your computer).
	ii) Click "Select Files" Button. Now you can select any single image or multiple images from your locally stored data.
	iii) Click "StartProcessing" Button. It will create instances for every image you selected earlier.
	iv) Hover your mouse pointer to get any color values both in RGB and YUV.
	v) Click particular pixel to store in log output.

#Conclusion:
	This application is very useful while working with image or real time video data.
